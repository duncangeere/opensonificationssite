<h1>The Open Sonifications Manifesto</h1>
<p>
    This is a manifesto in search of many sonifications. We invite you to use it as a map
    to explore the varied worlds of data + sound.
</p>
<h2>Core Ideas</h2>
<p>Sonification is not one thing, it is a diversity of things.</p>
<p>
    We embrace and encourage curious approaches to exploring the world through data +
    sound.
</p>
<p>
    The act of making a sonification is just as, if not more, important than the final
    outcome.
</p>
<h2>
    We seek to explore the edges of what is possible with sonification by challenging and
    expanding existing conventions about:
</h2>
<p>WHY we might sonify something (play, explore, feel, tinker)</p>
<p>WHAT we can DO with it (intention, process, meaning)</p>
<p>WHO gets to do things with it (anyone and everyone! no training required)</p>
<p>What counts as VALID SOUND (found sounds! weird sounds! ugly sounds! speech!!!)</p>
<p>
    What counts as VALID DATA (subjective data, personal data, the world is our dataset)
</p>
<p>What TOOLS we can use (our bodies, our emotions, our social connections)</p>
<h2>
    In addition to providing analytic insight (traditional goal), we acknowledge that
    sonifications can have other goals (open goals) that are just as meaningful.
</h2>
<p>They can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Transform us and the way we see the world</li>
    <li>Prompt us to examine our assumptions about how the world works</li>
    <li>Engage us in activism or political/social commentary (have a point of view)</li>
    <li>Allow us to express ourselves and to understand data through our bodies</li>
</ul>
<h2>We Love</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Decentralisation</li>
    <li>Expressiveness</li>
    <li>Performance</li>
    <li>Participation</li>
    <li>Community</li>
    <li>Danceability</li>
    <li>Approachability</li>
    <li>Raw energy</li>
    <li>Plural perspectives</li>
    <li>Making as a way of knowing</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We offer Open Sonifications as a counter-approach to dominant sonification strategies
    but believe they can (and should) co-exist. We donâ€™t wish to obliterate the status
    quo, but we do wish to extend it.
